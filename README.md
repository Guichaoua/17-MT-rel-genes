# 17 microtubule-related genes — code for Chapter 3

This repository accompanies Chapter 3 of my PhD thesis. It contains the code to:

1. Build the gene network for the 17 microtubule-related (MT-rel) genes, and

2. Reproduce the pCR prediction experiments (taxane-based chemotherapy; out-of-fold ROC–AUC) on public breast-cancer microarray cohorts.
